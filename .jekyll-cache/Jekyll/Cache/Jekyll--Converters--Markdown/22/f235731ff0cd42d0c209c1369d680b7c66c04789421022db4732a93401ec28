<p><strong>Dr. Wayesh Qarony</strong> is currently working as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the Inano research group with one of the most distinguished scientists, Prof. M. Saif Islam in the fields of nanotechnology, optics, and photonics at the University of California Davis, USA.</p>

<p>Dr. Wayesh is currently interested in nanophotonics design and fabrication techniques of the photodetector and multispectral image sensors with CMOS compatibility for the applications of biomedical imaging and high-speed communication systems, SPADs for Quantum Computing, and highly efficient solar cells and solar cells for the window applications.</p>

<p>Dr. Wayesh Qarony completed his Ph.D. with excellency in Applied Physics from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (QS Ranking: 75) under the supervision of Prof. Yuen Hong Tsang Peter (HK PolyU) and Prof. Dietmar Knipp (Stanford University), collaborating with the Stanford University, Jacobs University Bremen Germany, Tokyu Institute of Technology, and City University Hong Kong. He was an Awardee of the prestigious Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS). During his Ph.D. study, he published about 20 journal publications and attended 14 conference presentation. So far, Dr. Qarony published more than 35 SCI very high-impact journal publications, including Nano Energy, Advanced Science, Nano-Micro Letter, Nano Research, Journal of Materials Chemistry A and C, ACS Applied Materials Interfaces, Advanced Materials Interfaces, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, Solar Energy, Applied Energy, IEEE, Journal of Lightwave Technology, Optics Express, etc. He also attended over 25 international conferences, including MRS, OSA, SPIE, IEEE, and PVSEC. Additionally, he has a German patent in solar cell characterization in solar panel.</p>

<p>Dr. Qarony studied research-based M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (EE) with ‚ÄúHempel Fellowship‚Äù and university scholarship from Jacobs University Bremen (JUB), Germany, in 2013 with Prof. Dietmar Knipp (now at Stanford University). He also studied Master in Telecommunications Engineering at the University of Trento, Italy from 2010 to 2011. He achieved his B.Sc. in electrical and electronic engineering with scholarship and ‚ÄúSumma-Cum-Laude‚Äù gold medal award from American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB), in 2010. He also served as a Senior Lecturer of electrical and electronic engineering with the AIUB for 3 years</p>
